# _Perlin Noise Terrain Generator_

_June 3rd,2021_

#### _Creating a flyover effect using procedurally generated terrain!_

#### By _**Garrett Brown**_

## Description

A cool effect made to look like you're flying close to the mountains! This effect was created using the map(noise()) function, which creates a similar, yet muted effect in the vicinity of a designated point. (Similar to a noise in the real world.) There's definitely some potential with this to add textures, or mess with the translation height to create a realistic flying effect without even needing a camera import!
